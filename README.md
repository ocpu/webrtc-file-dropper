This is a service where users can create file sharing rooms and share the files over WebRTC.

Users can create rooms by going to the origin url. They are then "redirected" to a room they can use. Then they can share the url with the person they want to share files with. Rooms are automatically created and destroyed. If a user goes to a room that is not created they are then redirected to the origin.

When the users are sharing files they appear in a ever growing list of files shared between them.
